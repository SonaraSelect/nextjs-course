## Welcome to my project!

This project was adapted from fireship's next.js starter course. However,
the user submittable blogs feature is entirely by my own design.

## Setup

```
git clone <this-repo> nextcourse
cd nextcourse
npm install
```

If errors happen during the first `npm run dev`, then be sure to run `prisma generate` first.
